- Main FormSet GUID: `7b59104a-c00d-4158-87ff-f04d6396a915`
- Extracted forms: 63
- Extracted VarStores: 48
- Extracted English strings: 1336

## Primary ASUS notebook forms

| FormId | Title | Confirmed controls |
|---|---|---|
| `0x2716` | Main | BIOS information, vendor/version, VBIOS/EC, processor, memory, system information, serial, MAC/asset when exposed, date, time, access level |
| `0x2717` | Advanced | Internal Pointing Device, Fn Lock, Wake On Lid Open, SVM Mode, MyASUS auto-install mechanism, ASUS EZ Flash 3, SMART, Network Stack, USB, Trusted Computing, SATA, NVMe |
| `0x2718` | Boot | Fast Boot, Boot Option Priorities, Boot Option #N, Add New Boot Option, Delete Boot Option |
| `0x2719` | Security | Administrator/User password state and entry, I/O Interface Security, Secure Boot |
| `0x271A` | Save & Exit | Save/discard, defaults, Boot Override, EFI Shell |
| `0x271B` | Save & Exit | Save/discard/reset variants, user defaults, Boot Override |

## Confirmed referenced forms

- `0x2743` SMART Settings
- `0x2727` Network Stack Configuration
- `0x2728` USB Configuration
- Trusted Computing form
- SATA Configuration form
- `0x2760` NVMe Configuration
- I/O Interface Security form
- Secure Boot form

## Important runtime rule

The firmware uses `SuppressIf`, `GrayOutIf`, and `DisableIf` extensively. The screen reader must therefore retain IFR scope metadata and must not treat the static package order as equivalent to the currently visible firmware UI.

The native navigation engine tracks:

- FormId
- QuestionId
- conditional scope flags
- semantic IFR role
- prompt/help strings
- structural navigation across controls and forms

The next correctness gate is evaluating conditional expressions against live VarStores so hidden/disabled controls can be filtered according to the current firmware state.


## Native screen-reader command map

The BIOS 308 reader now exposes a read-only navigation layer plus a **non-persistent edit preview**:

| Key | Function |
|---|---|
| Arrow keys / Tab / Home / End / Page Up / Page Down | Move focus |
| Enter | Open a referenced HII form when safe |
| Esc | Return to the parent form |
| H | Speak HII contextual help |
| V | Speak the live firmware value |
| W | Where Am I: form + control + value |
| P | Speak position in the current form |
| R | Reload the current form from live VarStores and preserve focus |
| F/B/X/C/E (+ uppercase reverse variants) | Structural navigation by form/button/checkbox/choice/editable control |
| O / Shift+O | Preview next / previous OneOf value in RAM |
| Space | Preview checkbox toggle in RAM |
| D | Discard every staged preview edit |
| S | Save is deliberately blocked until a verified HII ConfigAccess/RouteConfig commit path exists |

### Safety invariant

Preview edits never call `SetVariable`, `RouteConfig`, or a vendor callback. They are stored only in the reader's RAM, announced as **preview**, and disappear when discarded or when the EFI application exits. Controls that are `GrayOutIf`-disabled or have unresolved conditional state cannot be activated or staged.

This gives the navigation layer a complete edit interaction model without risking Secure Boot, TPM, boot-order, password, or platform settings before the firmware-native commit path is validated.
